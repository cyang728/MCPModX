\title{Calculate Log Risk Ratio}
\usage{
calculate_logRR(p1, p0)
}
\arguments{
\item{p1}{A numeric value representing the probability of the event occurring in group 1.}

\item{p0}{A numeric value representing the probability of the event occurring in group 0.}
}
\value{
A numeric value representing the log risk ratio between \code{p1} and \code{p0}.
}
\description{
This function computes the log risk ratio (log RR) between two probabilities.
}
\examples{
# Example usage:
# Assuming p1 and p0 are the probabilities for two groups
# logRR <- calculate_logRR(0.7, 0.3)
}
